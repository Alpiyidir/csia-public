# MasterAccess
A database-driven web application for quiz scheduling and management that allows teachers to algorithmically schedule quizzes and allows students to view their grades.

The web application solves the main issue regarding quizzes. Teachers no longer have to waste time with scheduling as they can use MasterAccess to do it for them. If a teacher wants to schedule a quiz in the next two weeks, they can specify so and MasterAccess will determine the optimal date for the teacher.
